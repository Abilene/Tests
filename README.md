## Abilene's tech tests

In this repository you will find the tech tests that Abilene(me) solved using Java.

### Transposed 2-D Matrix

Description: Receives a matrix (manually) and prints out the transposed one.

``
transpose(int row, int column, int[][] matrix)
``
Solution: use a new matrix and pass the inverted size

### Zero Element 2-D matrix

Description: Write a function such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0 and then printed out.
Solution: copy the elements to a new matrix and then fill out rows and columns when a zero comes up.

### Sum
Calculate a sum

### Array of Strings

Given a sorted array of strings which is interspersed with empty strings, write a function to find the location
of a given string. I used a fixed array of Strings, I did not have much time to continue.

### String permutations
